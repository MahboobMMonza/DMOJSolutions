#DMOJ Solutions
____
This is a repository for all of my current DMOJ problem solutions to date, under the username
*saleemShady*. Information on each problem and the corresponding problem name for each
numbered file name can be found in the "info.json" file. As for files uploaded after July 30, 2021, their
names should appear more akin to the problems that were solved.

##Languages
Most solutions are in C++, while some may exist in Java and Python.

##Navigation
In order to find a solution to a specific problem, check the problem name at the end of the url for the link to that
problem in DMOJ (e.g. "CCC '15 S4 - Convex Hull" would have the URL: https://dmoj.ca/problem/ccc15s4, in which
the problem name would be found after the last '/', making it *ccc15s4*). Check if that problem name
exists in the repository as the file name. If not, open "info.json" and search for the problem name. Once it is
found, look at the object name for the searched problem, and open the file with the corresponding name.
